# The Manadome

Tournament and matchmaking app for Magic the Gathering.

## Welcome

This is a home project for coding practice, and to make it simpler in an awesome way for friends to get together for a game of Magic: the Gathering. It uses flutter, eventually for a cross platform app.

### Ideas

The application will be structured very similarly, but much simpler, than tha Audible app from amazon.
Login/register -> profile page with tabs on the bottom 1. Profile ala Tinder (Picture in magic card frame), 2. Leagues (much like facebook groups or Football manager leagues) with standings  and 3. "Store" with new frames and coloration available (last feature)

"popup" with current tournament like currently listening to on Audible.

Joining tournament in several ways. 1. using QR code - scan creators code to join his tournament or 2. Invite through league.

Notifications when: New tournament started in your league and when a new match found within the tournament.
